# CyberSafe

  ## Description
Poor cyber security habits can have very real financial costs to companies.  One study estimates that as of 2016, malicious cyber activity cost the U.S. economy between $57 billion and $109 billion.  CyberSafe seeks to improve cyber security habits by highlighting deficiencies in a user's cyber security habits.  The user will be directed to sign up for an accout to take a cyber security test.  The test actually occurs when the user is setting up the account, testing things like their password strength, how much private information they are comfortable giving out, and if they click on dubious redirect links.  After the signup is completed, they receive their grade with notes on what they did well and what needs improvement.
